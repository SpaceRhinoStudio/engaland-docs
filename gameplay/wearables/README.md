# Wearables

## Introduction

Wearables are a crucial part of the Engaverse. They are NFTs which you can see in your Endro's inventory. When one of your Endros possesses or equips a wearable, that wearable stays in that particular Endro's inventory and, it will be owned by that Endro until you transfer it again.

Should you wish to sell your Endro on a marketplace, you should be aware that all the wearables the Endro owns and wears will be sold alongside it as well.

Using Wearables it is possible to directly alter the rarity score of your Endro (Cosmetics), and also to alter the stats of your Endro (Chipset Cards) which will affect the rarity score of your Endro indirectly.

There are two types of wearables, cosmetics and chipset cards. You can read more about them on their own pages.
