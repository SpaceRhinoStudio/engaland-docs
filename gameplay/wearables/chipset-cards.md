# Chipset Cards

## Introduction

Chipset Cards are stat modifiers. They are equipped to slightly change the value of specific stats. They alter the raw value which subsequently affects the BRS. These raw values are on a bell-curve, so the extremes (0, 1) and (98, 99) are the best values you could get, for that reason, a decreasing modifier Chipset Card is just as valuable as an increasing one. Additionally, there is only four slots available for Chipset Cards.

There is a limit on how effective a Chipset Card could be, and that limit is determined by the [Zeal](../traits.md#zeal) of the Endro. As an example, if the Zeal is on a level where the limit is +/-5, and you equip four +3 Mentality Chipset Cards, you will not be able to increase your Endro's Mentality by more than +5.
