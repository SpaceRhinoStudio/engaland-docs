# Characteristic Of Realms

## Introduction

As we said before, each realm and corresponding citizens have their own culture and characteristics. Endros are manufactured in realms, so they come in different shapes of options and bonus.

## Realms

### UFM

### Magesta

### Nubia

### Sigr

### Komorebi

## Characteristics

### Zeal Bonus

Zeal modifier is a bonus value that each realm is given when Zeal action has been done by the player. For each realm there is different value which listed below. Remember, by default, each Zeal action increases the Zeal value by only one, with these modifiers dependent to realms, Zeal value can grow faster.

|   Realm  | Zeal Bonus |
| :------: | :--------: |
|    UFM   |     6%     |
|  Magesta |    2.5%    |
|   Nubia  |     3%     |
|   Sigr   |     2%     |
| Komorebi |     4%     |

### Zeal Decay

Zeal mechanism is an on-chain action and if the player doesn't look after its Endro in successive days it could decrease which has other consequences such as not be able to win Zeal Rarity Farming rewards and/or have an strict confiner on Endro's stat modifiers (Chipset Cards). Decay will happen in period of five days, meanwhile if an interaction with the Endro is done, decay mechanism will reset and starts from the last interaction. The player can do Zeal action every 48 hour.

|   Realm  |           120-hour Zeal Decay          |
| :------: | :------------------------------------: |
|    UFM   | -5 per each 120-hour period inactivity |
|  Magesta | -2 per each 120-hour period inactivity |
|   Nubia  | -1 per each 120-hour period inactivity |
|   Sigr   | -1 per each 120-hour period inactivity |
| Komorebi | -3 per each 120-hour period inactivity |

It means for example if an UFM Endro isn't received Zeal operation for 10 successive days, then its Zeal value will decreases by 10, and it's -6 for Komorebi.

### XP Bonus

Each Endro can gain maximum 10 XP per day by playing the games and participating in DAO or using consumables. Although there is a bonus modifier for each realm.

|   Realm  | XP Bonus |
| :------: | :------: |
|    UFM   |    1%    |
|  Magesta |   2.5%   |
|   Nubia  |   3.5%   |
|   Sigr   |    8%    |
| Komorebi |    2%    |

### Merit Point Bonus

As an Endro levels up, it receives some MeritPoint as reward to let the player modify its stats. The way Enga Federation calculates this is for some level up period it rewards some extra amount of MeritPoint.

|   Realm  |        MeritPoint Bonus       | Approximate Rate |
| :------: | :---------------------------: | :--------------: |
|    UFM   |  2 per each 9 level -> 2 / 9  |  0.222 per level |
|  Magesta |  2 per each 5 level -> 2 / 5  |   0.4 per level  |
|   Nubia  | 2 per each 10 level -> 2 / 10 |   0.2 per level  |
|   Sigr   | 1 per each 10 level -> 1 / 10 |   0.1 per level  |
| Komorebi |  1 per each 2 level -> 1 / 2  |   0.5 per level  |
