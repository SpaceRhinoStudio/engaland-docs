# Tickets

## Introduction

While it's easy to buy an Opifex Machine to construct an Endro, either from auctions or on the marketplace, obtaining wearables is much more exciting. Tickets are used to participate in raffles and gain those beautiful and powerful wearables as well as those magical consumables. Tickets can be purchased by the Solar gained from [staking](staking.md) or on the [marketplace](../gameplay/marketplace.md) using ENGA tokens.

Before going further, it's worth mentioning that raffles and draws also use ChainLink VRF to guarantee randomness and fairness.

## Buying Tickets

Once you have enough Solar, you can buy tickets on the Dapp. Solar, as was mentioned in the [Staking](staking.md) section, is not transferable and, it can only be used by the owner. Although, once you use your Solar to purchase tickets, you can list those tickets on a marketplace or use them in raffles.

There are five main categories of tickets:

* Cosmetic Raffles
* Chipset Card Raffles
* Consumables
* Accoutrement Card Raffles (not used yet)
* Drop Tickets

Just like the rarity types of [Cosmetics](../gameplay/wearables/cosmetics.md) and [Chipset Cards](../gameplay/wearables/chipset-cards.md), tickets for cosmetics and chipset cards are also divided into Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythical, and Celestial, with each one giving you a wearable of the same rarity.

Consumables are potions and boosters that help your Endro progress quicker.

Drop tickets are another method players have access to for obtaining an Endro.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Users are allowed to buy tickets of different categories in a single transaction. You do **not** need to create separate buy transactions for each type of raffle ticket.
{% endhint %}

## Raffles

Each raffle runs for a **period of time**, during this period you can submit your tickets for **a chance** to win prizes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Your tickets need to be submitted to the draw and this operation is not done automatically, also you don't need separate transaction for each ticket you submit to the draw, you can submit all of your tickets at once with just one transaction.
{% endhint %}

If on the other hand you don't want to participate in raffles and drops, you can sell your tickets to other players or accumulate them for subsequent raffles.
