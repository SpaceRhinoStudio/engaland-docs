### Initial Supply

|   Allocation | Percentage |    ENGA   |
| -----------: | :--------: | :-------: |
|    Seed Sale |     6%     |  300,000  |
|     Pre Sale |     40%    | 2,000,000 |
|          DAO |     20%    | 1,000,000 |

### Vesting

Our vesting program uses cliff mechanism for releasing locked tokens. This means a part of the locked tokens can be initially released one month after cliff start and at each month a portion of the remaining funds can be released.

Number of tokens released can be calculated by the following formula:

`monthly release = total tokens locked / (cliff duration - cliff start)`

|   Allocation | Cliff Start (months) | Cliff Duration (months) |
| -----------: | :------------------: | :---------------------: |
|    Seed Sale |           6          |            12           |
|     Pre Sale |           6          |            18           |
|          DAO |           6          |            12           |
| Stakeholders |           6          |            24           |

## Protocol Revenue
