# ENGA Token

## Introduction

How does the protocol work?

What gives value to these assets?

How do the players earn money?

ENGA is here to fill the gaps. You can use it to buy various on-chain assets like wearables, Opifex Machines which will become Endros, consumables, and much more. Furthermore, you can stake ENGA to become a part of the Enga Federation aka ENGADAO, stake it to earn [Solar](staking.md) to buy [Tickets](tickets.md), and finally stake it as a [Collateral](collateral.md) for your chosen Endro.

## Usage

ENGA is used to orchestrate an ecosystem between ENGADAO, NFT holders, and token holders in order to incentivize the users to participate more.

Players need ENGA to build, train, and upgrade their Endro. A portion of this token is transferred directly to ENGADAO to continue the development of the project. Meanwhile, the remaining amount is distributed as rewards between governance and users who have engaged in [Rarity Farming](../gameplay/rarity-farming.md).

That has been explained more in detail in the [Tokenomic](tokenomics.md) section.

## Where to Use

You can do the following:

* Buy [Opifex Machines](../gameplay/opifex-machine.md)
* Buy [Wearables](../gameplay/wearables/) including [Cosmetics](../gameplay/wearables/cosmetics.md) and [Chipset Cards](../gameplay/wearables/chipset-cards.md)
* Buy [Consumables](../gameplay/consumables.md)
* [Stake](staking.md) ENGA to earn Solar, and then use those to buy [Tickets](tickets.md) and participate in raffles
* [Stake](staking.md) ENGA as a [Collateral](collateral.md) to construct your chosen Endro

## How Can You Earn ENGA?
