# Staking

## Introduction

Staking is the process of locking up your tokens in return for rewards. By staking ENGA token in the dapp, you can gain Solar which is a non transferable asset and only belongs to you.

To start your opifex machine and construct your Endro, you have to stake a minimum amount of ENGA or other LPs (as soon as they are added), which lets you earn rewards based on the [tokenomic](tokenomics.md). Subsequently, the value of your Endro will grow, as the rewards you gain on your Endro's staking are accumulated. At any moment, should you wish, you can burn your Endro to withdraw the rewards and the ENGA or LP you had staked.

## Solar

Solar is simply a variable in our Smart Contract that acts like a balance value. You cannot buy or sell Solar, as it isn't an actual currency, however, you can earn it by staking our ENGA Token or other available liquidity pools (LPs), while each option has its own interest rate. You can use Solar to buy [Tickets](tickets.md), to participate in raffles and draws. The more tickets you submit, the higher the chance you have of winning.
