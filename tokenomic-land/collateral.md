# Collateral

## Introduction

After you get your Opifex Machine, and have it index the candidates, the machine needs fuel to construct the Endro of your choosing, and that fuel is called "Power Source" or "Collateral". Once you provide the power source, the machine will charge up and constructs the Endro. The power source is not burnt, but rather stored inside the Endro, and as the time goes on the power source will increase in amount. However, upon the destruction or burning of the Endro, the power source will be returned to you.

In other words, the power source is a type of staking token which, just like any other type of staking, provides rewards for the staker.

## About

By staking the collateral, you will gain rewards, as specified in the tokenomic and the value of the collateral will increase. The amount of collateral that you need to provide differs based on the candidate you have chosen to construct, the rarer the candidate, the more collateral you need to provide.

The collateral you provide sets the base value of the Endro, and due to the fact that the collateral is stored inside the Endro, the rewards are also kept inside the Endro, therefore the value of the Endro will increase as the time goes on.

For the time being, only ENGA is supported as collateral, however that might change in the future and more LPs will be supported.
