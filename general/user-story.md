# User Story

## Introduction

In this section, the flow of the platform and how you can interact with it will be explained in detail. It is being updated constantly to cover and reflect any future additions and changes to the platform.

## Pages

### Landing Page

You, as the player, can see the brief summary and the roadmap of the Engaverse, what and where Engaland is, and an introduction to the five realms and their stories. From there, you can head over to the Dapp to start your journey through in the Engaverse, or head straight to the marketplace and see the market for yourself.

### Dapp

At first, you have to connect your wallet on the top right side of the Dapp, then you see a menu of different pages as listed below.

#### Dashboard

Here you can see information on your account, such as the Endros, Wearables, Tickets, and other NFTs you may own, and How many ENGA tokens and Solar balance you may have.

#### Marketplace

Simply put, the marketplace is where players can list the items they own for sale, or buy items from other players. These items can be anything from a wearable to an Endro with its full inventory of items.

#### Staking

To be able to participate in raffles you need to buy tickets, which can be done in two ways, either by buying one from another player through a marketplace, or by staking tokens and LPs to gain Solar (which is not transferable and at the moment is only used to buy tickets). Be aware staking for tickets is different from staked collaterals, the former rewards you in Solar which is a non-transferable token and is only used to buy tickets, while the latter rewards with ENGA tokens with a dynamic APY (based on the tokenomic) and that rewards is held in your Endro.

#### Bonding Curve

The heart of the platform is the bonding curve that mints ENGA token based on the reserve token, which is [DAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai\_\(cryptocurrency\)). Without needing a third-party CEX or DEX, you can freely and safely buy/sell your ENGA tokens and also monitor the orders that go through the Bonding Curve Smart Contract. Although, the bonding curve is not the only method of buying/selling ENGA tokens, the token will be added to different exchanges, for trading with convenience.

#### Auction

In the past, the way most projects used to distribute their NFTs was the first-in first-serve method which wasn't fair. However, nowadays, there are auction systems that let participants who have been outbid to gain profit. It's win-win for everyone. Such a system is used on the platform to put Opifex Machines on auctions. Nevertheless, other types of NFTs could be added in the future.

#### Enga Federation (ENGADAO)

At the federation you can see proposals and how much voting power you may have. On this page, the treasury is also available for monitoring and viewing.

### Play

The functionality of Play is not implemented yet, and it will redirect you to the dapp. As soon as the on-chain squad builder game were ready, you will be able to play it. Also we are making steam-quality games for desktops so you could play them too.

We are going to simulate a synthetic player who knows little about the platform.
