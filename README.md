# Where Is ENGALAND ?

## Introduction

Engaland, the biggest planet in the Engaverse, uncharted and unexplored, is a world of unknowns and mysteries. For years, the five realms of the Engaverse attempted to explore and colonize the planet, but were unable to do so, until now. The recent invention of Opifex Machines and the development of specialized droids, known as Endros, has allowed the five realms to set foot on the planet without risking lives of their citizens.

## Enga Federation - ENGADAO

Eventually, in order to stop unnecessary conflicts and wars between the five realms, the Enga Federation, aka "ENGADAO", was formed. An interplanetary organization to keep the peace in the Engaverse, and coordinate the efforts of the five realms to colonize Engaland.

## Engaland

Owned by the Enga Federation, Engaland has yet to be tamed and conquered by anyone. The gigantic planet is a home to various species of beings, ordinary albeit unknown and possibly dangerous creatures. So far, Enga Federation has been unable to find any sign of intelligent lifeforms on the planet. It is up to Endros to explore the planet and her mysteries.

## Opifex Machine and Endros

Opifex Machines were invented by a team of the best scientists and engineers of the five realms, under the leadership of the Enga Federation. These machines are built only for the purpose of exploring Engaland, however, the materials needed to build them are in a short supply. These machines are able to construct specialized droids, known as Endros, as long as they are provided with the materials, blueprints, and the fuel needed to build them.

Endros are the most advanced droids in the Engaverse, however, this technology is still under development, and with each generation, Endros are fine-tuned to specialize in specific tasks. Endros do not have a mind of their own, and each Endro is designed to be operated by citizens of the five realms.

## [Realms](gameplay/characteristic-of-realms.md)

The five realms of the Engaverse refers to the five distinct planets which seem to be the only planets hosting intelligent and sentient beings. Each realm has their own unique culture and way of life, and the process of unifying their home planets was different for each realm.

Due to evolving separately from each other, citizens of each realm have distinct characteristics, talents, and skills. Their role is to control, operate and develop Endros gradually.
